                <p class="p1">Chicken</p>
                <p class="p2">Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. 
                    Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to 
                    animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout 
                    the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes. </p>
